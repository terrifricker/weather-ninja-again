# weather-ninja-again

I am following a tutorial from NetNinja JavaScript Course from Udemy. I have done it previously, 
but I am doing it again to refresh my memory.  The project is a form with a field for entering a city.
Using async and promises, this page gets a city code from AccuTemp API, then gets current weather data
for that city (using the code).

I am working toward creating and manipulating databases from my websites.
